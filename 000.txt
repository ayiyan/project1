Secure code as you write it. Automatically review every change to your codebase and identify vulnerabilities before they reach production.

Host code that you don't want to share with the world in private GitHub repos only accessible to you and people you share them with.

Add an extra layer of security with two -actor authentication (2FA) when logging into GitHub. Require 2FA and choose from TOTP apps, security keys, and more.
